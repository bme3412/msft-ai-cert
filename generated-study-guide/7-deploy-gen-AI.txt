Deploy Generative AI Models
🧠 1. GPT-4 / GPT-4 Turbo
What They Are

GPT-4 → most capable model, designed for deep reasoning, summarization, copilots.

GPT-4 Turbo → optimized version: cheaper, faster, longer context (128K tokens in some versions).

Use Cases

Complex multi-turn chatbots (customer support, HR copilots).

Summarization of long documents (financial, legal, medical).

Code generation & debugging assistants.

Domain-specific copilots (analyst assistant, healthcare Q&A).

Considerations

Higher cost than GPT-3.5, but better accuracy.

Turbo models are preferred for production (cost-efficient + extended context).

⚡ 2. GPT-3.5
What It Is

Lightweight, lower-cost model.

Ideal for high-volume, less complex tasks.

Use Cases

Simple Q&A bots (FAQ assistants).

Drafting content like email replies, blog outlines.

Pre-processing tasks: classify text before feeding into GPT-4.

Considerations

Lower accuracy in nuanced reasoning.

Cost-effective for workloads with millions of requests/day.

🔍 3. Embeddings Models
What They Are

Models that convert text/images → vector representations (embeddings).

Used for semantic similarity, clustering, retrieval.

Use Cases

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): index documents → query embeddings → provide context to GPT.

Semantic search (search “How do I reset my password?” → retrieves correct FAQ).

Clustering (grouping customer feedback by themes).

Recommendation systems (similar product/content).

Considerations

Embeddings ≠ text generation. They support GPT by providing grounding.

Requires Azure AI Search or vector database to store/query embeddings.

🎨 4. DALL·E
What It Is

Generative model for text-to-image.

Supports inpainting & editing (modify existing images).

Use Cases

Marketing: create ad campaign visuals.

E-commerce: auto-generate product mockups.

Creative tools: image variations, artistic designs.

Considerations

Images cost per request (size-based pricing).

Governance: content moderation applies (no violent/sexual imagery).

🖼 5. Multimodal (GPT-4 with Vision)
What It Is

GPT-4 model that accepts text + images as input.

Can generate text output from multimodal input.

Use Cases

Analyze product defects from photos.

Captioning images (accessibility tools).

Interpret charts/graphs in reports.

Healthcare: analyze medical scans alongside doctor’s notes.

Considerations

Output is still text only (not generating new images).

Useful for image understanding, not creative image generation (DALL·E is for that).

📌 Best Practices

Pick the right model for the job:

GPT-4 Turbo → copilots, deep reasoning, summarization.

GPT-3.5 → bulk/low-cost tasks.

Embeddings → RAG & semantic search.

DALL·E → text → image.

GPT-4V → image understanding + text reasoning.

Start cheap → scale up: prototype with GPT-3.5, move to GPT-4 Turbo if accuracy required.

Combine models:

GPT-4 for reasoning + embeddings for retrieval + DALL·E for visuals.
