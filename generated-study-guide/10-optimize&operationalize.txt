Optimize & Operationalize Generative AI Solutions
⚙️ 1. Configure Model Behavior
Key Parameters

temperature → randomness in output.

Low (0.0–0.3): deterministic, precise.

High (0.7–1.0): creative, varied responses.

top_p (nucleus sampling) → probability mass of tokens to sample from.

Alternative to temperature; controls diversity.

max_tokens → sets length of output.

Prevents runaway responses.

frequency_penalty → reduces repetition of same phrases.

presence_penalty → encourages introducing new topics.

Best Practice: Tune temperature + top_p together to balance creativity and reliability.

📊 2. Monitoring & Diagnostics
Tools

Azure Monitor → track metrics (latency, request counts, quota).

Application Insights → trace dependencies, analyze response times.

Diagnostics logs → inspect input/output requests for debugging.

Key Metrics to Track

Latency → response speed.

Token consumption → billing driver.

Quota usage → ensures you don’t hit limits.

Error rates → monitor failed calls.

Best Practice: Enable prompt logging & tracing in App Insights for debugging prompt flows.

🚀 3. Optimize Resources

Autoscaling policies → scale endpoints up/down with demand.

Model selection strategy:

GPT-3.5 → cheap bulk tasks (classification, drafts).

GPT-4 → complex reasoning & accuracy-critical.

Stay current: Azure frequently updates foundation models → migrate when possible for efficiency.

Best Practice: Use a hybrid approach (tiered models) to balance cost and performance.

🔁 4. Feedback & Reflection

Human-in-the-loop feedback

Collect thumbs up/down + qualitative comments.

Feed into model evaluation/retraining pipeline.

Model reflection

Secondary LLM evaluates/filters outputs of the primary.

Example: GPT-3.5 generates → GPT-4 validates/corrects.

Best Practice: Use reflection + user feedback loops to improve production accuracy.

🖥 5. Containers & Edge Deployment

OpenAI models (GPT, DALL·E) → cloud-only, no container deployment.

Other services (Vision, Speech, Form Recognizer) → containerized for on-prem or edge.

Edge scenarios: latency-sensitive, offline, compliance-heavy (healthcare, defense).

Best Practice: Deploy containers for edge apps but remember GPT = cloud only.

🔗 6. Orchestration of Multiple Models

Combine models for complex workflows:

GPT-4 → reasoning, summarization.

Embeddings model → semantic search & RAG.

DALL·E → visual generation.

Frameworks:

LangChain → Python/JS orchestration for chaining prompts, tools, and retrieval.

Semantic Kernel → Microsoft’s orchestration framework (C#, Python).

Best Practice: Orchestrate smaller models for specific tasks instead of always calling GPT-4.

🧾 7. Prompt Engineering

Few-shot prompting → include examples for consistent responses.

Chain-of-thought prompting → ask model to reason step by step.

Role prompting → “You are a financial analyst…” sets behavior.

Guardrail prompting → explicitly restrict disallowed outputs.

Best Practice: Use structured prompts (templates, roles, examples) to reduce hallucinations.

🛠 8. Fine-Tuning

What It Is: Train a base OpenAI model with custom data (JSONL).

When to Use:

Style-specific tasks (legal writing, brand tone).

Repeated Q&A in niche domains.

Not a Replacement for RAG:

Fine-tuning = style & domain adaptation.

RAG = grounding in current, large, or dynamic datasets.

Best Practice: Fine-tune smaller models (GPT-3.5) for cost efficiency; use RAG for freshness.

✅ Exam Triggers

Control creativity/determinism → adjust temperature & top_p.

Scenario: GPT-4 costs too high → switch to GPT-3.5 for bulk tasks.

Scenario: chatbot hallucinating → implement RAG or guardrail prompting.

Scenario: compliance requires on-prem AI → containerized Vision/Speech/Form Recognizer.

Scenario: improve responses using user feedback → implement human-in-the-loop + reflection.

Scenario: orchestrating reasoning + retrieval + image generation → combine GPT-4, embeddings, DALL·E via LangChain/Semantic Kernel.

Scenario: maintain brand tone in responses → fine-tuning.

Scenario: trace/debug prompts in production → enable logging in App Insights.
