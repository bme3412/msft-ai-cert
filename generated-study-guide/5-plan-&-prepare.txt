1. Define the Business Case
What It Means

Before selecting models or deploying services, you must clearly define why you‚Äôre building the solution.

Chatbots & Copilots

Automate customer service, IT helpdesk, HR policy Q&A.

Key requirement ‚Üí real-time interaction with guardrails.

Best-fit models ‚Üí GPT-4 Turbo (multi-turn, cost-effective).

Summarization

Condense long text (earnings calls, legal docs, medical transcripts).

Requirement ‚Üí abstractive summarization, accuracy, domain safety.

Best-fit models ‚Üí GPT-4 for complex text, GPT-3.5 for cost-sensitive.

Code Generation

Developer copilots, code explanations, test automation.

Requirement ‚Üí programming language knowledge, multi-turn refinement.

Best-fit models ‚Üí GPT-4 Turbo (reasoning, structured output).

Multimodal Solutions

Accept text + images (GPT-4-Vision) or text ‚Üí image (DALL¬∑E).

Example use cases:

Analyze product defects from an image and recommend fixes.

Generate ad campaign images based on product descriptions.

Best Practices

Tie the business case ‚Üí measurable ROI (reduced call volume, faster reporting, improved developer velocity).

Keep Responsible AI principles in mind from the start.

Document functional + non-functional requirements:

Latency (real-time vs. batch).

Accuracy (domain expertise required).

Cost (token volume, frequency of calls).

üìÇ 2. Identify Data Sources
Why It Matters

Generative AI is only as good as the data grounding it. Microsoft expects you to map source ‚Üí ingestion ‚Üí grounding before implementation.

Common Data Sources

Documents: PDFs, Word, PowerPoint (stored in Blob, SharePoint, OneDrive).

Databases: SQL, CosmosDB, Data Lake.

Images: product catalogs, scanned receipts, diagnostic images.

Proprietary Knowledge: internal policies, call transcripts, financial records.

Data Prep Steps

Ingest: Store data in Blob/SQL ‚Üí connect to AI Foundry.

Enrich: Use AI Search to index (OCR, NER, embeddings).

Ground: Pass top results as context to LLM (RAG pattern).

Secure: Control access with Key Vault + RBAC.

Best Practices

Assess data quality ‚Üí noisy/inconsistent docs cause poor grounding.

Consider compliance requirements (PII, GDPR, HIPAA).

Use metadata tagging (timestamps, categories) for better retrieval.

üîß 3. Select the Best Deployment Pattern

Microsoft will test whether you can pick the right AI usage pattern for a scenario.

A. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

When to Use: Knowledge-base Q&A, domain-specific copilots.

How:

Store docs ‚Üí create embeddings ‚Üí index in Azure AI Search.

Retrieve top N docs ‚Üí provide as context to GPT.

Benefit: Reduces hallucination, uses external knowledge.

Example: An HR chatbot that answers questions from the company handbook.

B. Fine-Tuning

When to Use:

Model must mimic style (legal writing, brand tone).

Model needs custom domain (insurance claims, pharma trials).

How: Train a base model with JSONL dataset (input ‚Üí ideal output).

Benefit: Improves style consistency and accuracy in narrow domains.

Example: An AI that generates legal contracts in the firm‚Äôs preferred format.

C. Zero-Shot / Few-Shot Prompting

Zero-Shot: Ask model to perform a task without examples.

Example: ‚ÄúTranslate this text into French.‚Äù

Few-Shot: Provide a handful of examples in the prompt.

Example: Show 3 Q&A pairs ‚Üí model answers a new question in same style.

Benefit: Fastest to deploy; no training or external data required.

Example: Ad copy generation without domain-specific grounding.
