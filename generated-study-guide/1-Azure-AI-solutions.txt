1. Selecting the Appropriate Azure AI Foundry Services
üß† Generative AI ‚Äî Azure OpenAI Service
Core Capabilities

Access to OpenAI foundation models hosted in Azure:

GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo ‚Üí reasoning, multi-turn chat, summarization, content creation.

GPT-3.5 ‚Üí lower-cost option for simpler tasks.

Embeddings API ‚Üí convert text into vectors for semantic search, clustering, or recommendation.

DALL¬∑E ‚Üí text-to-image generation (also image inpainting/editing).
