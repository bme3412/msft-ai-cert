4. Implement AI Solutions Responsibly
🛡️ Content Moderation
Service: Azure AI Content Safety

Built to detect and filter harmful or unwanted content in:

Text: hate speech, self-harm, sexual, violence, profanity.

Images: adult/sexual, violent, gore.

Features

Categories: sexual, violence, hate, self-harm, harassment.

Severity levels: classify content as safe, low risk, medium risk, high risk.

Real-time moderation: filter prompts/responses in chatbots before showing to end users.

Best Practices

Always enable filters in OpenAI deployments.

Use multi-layered filtering (pre-input + post-output).

Route high-risk outputs for human review.

Hands-on Practice

Deploy Azure AI Content Safety.

Submit harmful text snippets → see severity scores.

Apply profanity filter to GPT-4 chatbot endpoint.

📊 Responsible AI Insights
Purpose

Monitor and audit AI system outputs over time.

Provide dashboards for:

Content moderation activity.

Bias detection (e.g., gender/ethnicity bias in outputs).

Usage patterns → detect drift or misuse.

Tools

Azure AI Studio: built-in safety dashboards.

Azure Monitor + App Insights: track harmful response frequency.

Custom RAI metrics: fairness, accuracy, inclusiveness.

Hands-on Practice

Configure a dashboard in AI Studio → track blocked prompts.

Run analytics on token usage + flagged outputs.

Export moderation logs to Log Analytics → query with KQL.

🚫 Prevent Harmful Behavior
Threats

Jailbreak attacks: users try to bypass safety filters.

Prompt injection: malicious prompts attempt to override system instructions.

Model misuse: generating disallowed content (deepfakes, disinformation).

Defenses

Prompt Shields

Pre-input validation to detect jailbreak attempts.

E.g., detect “ignore previous instructions” in a prompt.

Blocklists

Custom forbidden words/phrases (e.g., competitor names, insider terms).

Rate limiting

Prevent brute-force attempts to probe safety boundaries.

Layered Moderation

Input filtering → model → output filtering.

Hands-on Practice

Add a blocklist with banned terms in Azure AI Studio.

Test a known jailbreak prompt → confirm rejection.

Implement retry logic → block repeated harmful attempts.

🏛 Governance
Why Governance Matters

AI must comply with laws, ethics, and enterprise standards.

Prevents reputational, financial, and legal risks.

Elements of Governance Framework

Policy Definition

Define what AI can and cannot do.

Example: "AI must never give medical diagnoses."

Compliance & Ethics Review

Regular audits (internal + external).

Ensure GDPR, HIPAA, and industry-specific compliance.

Human Oversight

Create escalation paths: when AI flags “high severity,” a human approves before release.

Documentation & Transparency

Model cards: describe intended use cases, limitations, and risks.

End-user communication: inform when AI is in use.

Hands-on Practice

Draft a Responsible AI governance policy for a chatbot project.

Define an escalation workflow (AI → review team → release/deny).

Build a RAI checklist: bias review, fairness testing, ethical approval.
