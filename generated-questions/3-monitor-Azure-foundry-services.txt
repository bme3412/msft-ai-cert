Manage, Monitor, and Secure Azure AI Foundry Services
Q1. Monitoring Basics

Which tool would you use to track latency, error rates, and token consumption for an Azure OpenAI deployment?

A. Azure Key Vault
B. Azure Monitor
C. Azure Resource Manager
D. Azure DevOps

✅ Answer: B – Azure Monitor provides metrics on performance, including latency and errors.

Q2. Application Insights

A developer wants to trace API calls to an Azure AI endpoint and measure end-to-end response times. Which tool is best?

A. Diagnostics Logs
B. Application Insights
C. Azure DevOps
D. Azure AI Studio

✅ Answer: B – App Insights provides telemetry for dependencies, response times, and custom events.

Q3. Diagnostics Logs

What is the main use of Diagnostics Logs for an Azure AI Foundry service?

A. Store API keys securely
B. Automate model retraining
C. Collect system-level logs such as request/response data
D. Translate logs into different languages

✅ Answer: C – Diagnostics Logs capture detailed request/response and system-level activity.

Q4. Cost Management

Your project manager asks you to prevent monthly Azure AI costs from exceeding $2,000. Which feature should you configure?

A. Azure Cost Management + Budgets
B. Azure AI Studio prompt shields
C. Application Insights
D. Azure Key Vault

✅ Answer: A – Budgets in Azure Cost Management allow you to set spend limits and trigger alerts.

Q5. Quota & Token Tracking

Which of the following would be the best way to ensure your GPT-4 usage does not exceed quota unexpectedly?

A. Rotate API keys monthly
B. Set alerts in Azure Monitor for token consumption
C. Deploy services via container for offline use
D. Use CI/CD pipelines for deployments

✅ Answer: B – Token consumption monitoring ensures quotas are not exceeded.

Q6. Key Security

Where should you store Azure AI API keys to keep them secure?

A. Environment variables on a developer’s laptop
B. Azure Blob Storage
C. Azure Key Vault
D. In source code repositories

✅ Answer: C – Azure Key Vault is the recommended secure store for API keys and secrets.

Q7. Key Rotation

Why does Azure provide primary and secondary keys for AI services?

A. To allow high availability across multiple regions
B. To make quota usage double
C. To enable smooth key rotation without downtime
D. To reduce token costs

✅ Answer: C – Having two keys allows rotation (swap keys without breaking service).

Q8. Authentication — Best Practice

Which is the most secure method of authenticating applications to Azure AI services?

A. Hard-coding API keys in source code
B. Storing API keys in Azure Key Vault
C. Using Managed Identity with role-based access control
D. Creating a new API key for every developer

✅ Answer: C – Managed Identity is the most secure because it removes the need for keys altogether.

Q9. Trick Question — Monitoring vs. Security

A security officer asks you to audit failed authentication attempts against your Azure AI resource. Which tool is most appropriate?

A. Azure Cost Management
B. Diagnostics Logs
C. Application Insights
D. Azure AI Studio

✅ Answer: B – Diagnostics Logs capture authentication failures and request activity.

Q10. Trick Question — Cost vs. Monitoring

Your GPT-4 workload is exceeding its budget because developers are testing prompts without limits. Which TWO actions help?

A. Configure usage quotas and budget alerts.
B. Store API keys in Azure Key Vault.
C. Use Managed Identity instead of keys.
D. Monitor token consumption in Azure Monitor.

✅ Answer: A and D – Budgets/quotas control cost, while token monitoring detects spikes.
