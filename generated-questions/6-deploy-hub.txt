Deploy Hub, Project, and Resources
Q1. Hub vs Project

Which statement best describes the difference between a Hub and a Project in Azure AI Foundry?

A. A hub contains multiple projects; a project contains datasets, models, and flows.
B. A project contains multiple hubs; a hub contains only datasets.
C. A hub is created per user; a project is created per subscription.
D. A project manages billing; a hub is for experiments.

✅ Answer: A – Hubs organize multiple projects, and projects hold resources like models, data, and prompt flows.

Q2. Resource Setup

You are creating a RAG-based legal assistant project. Which services must you deploy in your project?

A. Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI
B. DALL·E and GPT-4 Vision
C. Azure Key Vault only
D. Application Insights only

✅ Answer: A – RAG requires Azure AI Search (indexing/embeddings) and OpenAI for response generation.

Q3. Storage Selection

Where should you store unstructured documents (PDF case files) so they can later be indexed for use in a generative AI project?

A. Azure Key Vault
B. Azure Blob Storage
C. Cosmos DB
D. Application Insights

✅ Answer: B – Blob Storage is the best option for large, unstructured files.

Q4. Secrets Management

Where should you store API keys and connection strings for AI Foundry projects?

A. Inside the application codebase.
B. Azure AI Studio playground.
C. Azure Key Vault.
D. A GitHub repository.

✅ Answer: C – Azure Key Vault is the secure location for managing secrets.

Q5. Cosmos DB Use Case

Which scenario is the best fit for using Cosmos DB in an AI Foundry project?

A. Storing vector embeddings for RAG.
B. Storing structured customer records for grounding queries.
C. Storing large PDFs for OCR.
D. Storing API keys securely.

✅ Answer: B – Cosmos DB is used for structured datasets that can be referenced in grounding.

Q6. Hub Governance

A global company wants to separate AI workloads for Finance, HR, and Customer Support while applying different RBAC roles and monitoring for each unit. What should they create?

A. A single hub with multiple projects.
B. A separate project for each user.
C. Multiple hubs, one per business unit.
D. Multiple storage accounts without hubs.

✅ Answer: C – Each business unit should have its own hub, containing projects for specific solutions.

Q7. Trick Question — AI Search vs Blob

An insurance company uploads scanned claim forms to Blob Storage. They want a chatbot that retrieves answers directly from these documents. Which additional service is required?

A. Azure AI Search to index the documents.
B. Azure Key Vault to store embeddings.
C. Application Insights to track latency.
D. DALL·E to visualize claims.

✅ Answer: A – Blob stores the docs, but AI Search indexes them for RAG queries.

Q8. Project Lifecycle

Which of the following would you expect to manage at the Project level in AI Foundry?

A. Assigning OpenAI quota to subscription.
B. Deploying datasets, models, and prompt flows.
C. Configuring enterprise-wide RBAC policies.
D. Tracking billing across multiple departments.

✅ Answer: B – Projects are scoped to datasets, models, prompt flows.

Q9. Security Scenario

A developer is testing an AI solution and hard-coded the Azure OpenAI key into a Python script. What’s the correct way to fix this in a production project?

A. Use Azure Monitor to rotate the key automatically.
B. Move the key into Azure Key Vault and fetch via Managed Identity.
C. Store the key in Blob Storage with encryption.
D. Keep the key but add comments for clarity.

✅ Answer: B – Key Vault + Managed Identity is the secure way.

Q10. Complex Scenario

Your team is building a financial research copilot. You need:

GPT-4 Turbo for reasoning.

AI Search for grounding with financial reports.

Secure storage of API keys.

A structure to separate projects for “Analyst Copilot” and “Portfolio Copilot.”

Which setup is correct?

A. One hub → multiple projects (Analyst Copilot, Portfolio Copilot) → deploy OpenAI, AI Search, Blob Storage, Key Vault.
B. Multiple hubs per project → deploy only OpenAI.
C. One hub with one project → deploy only GPT-4 Turbo.
D. Multiple projects per user → store keys in app code.

✅ Answer: A – Correct setup is Hub → Projects → Resources (OpenAI, AI Search, Blob, Key Vault).
