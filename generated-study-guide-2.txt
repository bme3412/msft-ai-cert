Implement Generative AI Solutions (15‚Äì20%)
üèó Build Generative AI Solutions with Azure AI Foundry
1. Plan & Prepare

Define business case: chatbot, summarization, code generation, multimodal.

Identify data sources: PDFs, databases, images, proprietary knowledge.

Select best deployment pattern: RAG, fine-tuning, zero-shot/few-shot.

2. Deploy Hub, Project, and Resources

Hub = top-level workspace in Azure AI Foundry (like a container for projects).

Project = scoped environment with resources (datasets, models, prompt flows).

Deploy necessary services:

Azure OpenAI

Azure AI Search (for RAG grounding)

Storage accounts (Blob, CosmosDB)

Key Vault (secrets)

Practice: Create a hub + project in AI Studio ‚Üí deploy Azure OpenAI + Azure AI Search.

3. Deploy Generative AI Models

GPT-4 / GPT-4 Turbo: reasoning, summarization, copilots.

GPT-3.5: cost-efficient lightweight tasks.

Embeddings models: semantic search, clustering.

DALL¬∑E: image generation.

Multimodal (GPT-4 with Vision): analyze text + images.

üîÑ Implement Prompt Flows & RAG
1. Prompt Flow Solutions

A visual + code workflow tool for building generative AI pipelines.

Allows chaining: data prep ‚Üí model call ‚Üí post-processing.

Integrates with evaluation tools (BLEU, ROUGE, GPT-based evaluators).

Can include safety filters (Content Safety, prompt shields).

Practice: Build a simple flow that:

Accepts a user query.

Calls GPT-4.

Applies moderation filter.

Outputs final response.

2. RAG Pattern (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Grounding: use external data to enrich LLM responses.

Typical pipeline:

Store docs in Blob ‚Üí index with Azure AI Search ‚Üí query embeddings.

Pass top results as context in GPT prompt.

Prevents hallucination; keeps model domain-specific.

Practice: Build a RAG app where GPT-4 answers questions about company policies from a PDF.

3. Evaluate Models & Flows

Metrics: accuracy, fluency, coherence, safety.

Use Azure AI Evaluation SDK or AI Studio evaluation dashboard.

Collect user feedback for real-world tuning.

ü§ñ Use Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models
1. Provision Azure OpenAI

Create a Foundry Models resource in Azure AI Foundry.

Assign quota for models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, embeddings).

2. Select & Deploy Models

GPT-4 Turbo: complex reasoning, chat apps.

GPT-3.5: fast + cost-effective.

DALL¬∑E: image generation (prompt ‚Üí image).

Multimodal GPT-4: accepts both image + text input.

3. Submit Prompts

Via AI Studio playground or SDK (openai for GPT, azure-ai-inference).

Generate:

Natural language responses

Summaries

Code completions

Images (DALL¬∑E)

4. Build Assistants

Azure OpenAI Assistants API supports:

Multi-turn conversations.

Tool calling (functions, APIs).

Memory storage.

Practice: Create an AI Assistant that answers product FAQs with memory across turns.

‚öôÔ∏è Optimize & Operationalize Generative AI Solutions
1. Configure Model Behavior

Parameters:

temperature: creativity vs determinism.

top_p: nucleus sampling.

max_tokens: length of response.

frequency_penalty & presence_penalty: reduce repetition.

2. Monitoring & Diagnostics

Use Azure Monitor + App Insights:

Latency

Token consumption

Quota usage

Error rates

Enable tracing with prompt logging for debugging.

3. Optimize Resources

Scale endpoints: set autoscaling policies.

Use smaller models (GPT-3.5) for cheap bulk tasks, GPT-4 for high-accuracy cases.

Keep up with foundation model updates from Azure.

4. Feedback & Reflection

Human-in-the-loop feedback: thumbs up/down, qualitative reviews.

Model reflection: secondary LLM evaluates/filters the output of the primary LLM.

Helps refine answers in production.

5. Containers & Edge Deployment

Deploy OpenAI models as containers not supported ‚Üí but Vision, Speech, Form Recognizer are.

For multimodal edge apps ‚Üí containerized deployments reduce latency.

6. Orchestration of Multiple Models

Use multiple LLMs in workflow:

GPT-4 for reasoning.

Embeddings model for retrieval.

DALL¬∑E for image generation.

Combine with LangChain or Semantic Kernel for orchestration.

7. Prompt Engineering

Few-shot prompting: provide examples.

Chain-of-thought: guide model reasoning.

Role prompting: ‚ÄúYou are a financial analyst‚Ä¶‚Äù

Guardrail prompting: explicitly restrict behavior.

8. Fine-Tuning

Upload training dataset (JSONL).

Use OpenAI fine-tuning endpoints.

Improves model performance on niche domains (legal docs, company-specific Q&A).

Still requires RAG for current/large datasets.
