Study Guide – Azure AI Solution (20–25%)
1. Selecting the Appropriate Azure AI Foundry Services
Generative AI

Azure OpenAI Service

GPT, GPT-4 Turbo, Embeddings, DALL-E, etc.

Use for text generation, summarization, chatbots, image generation.

Practice: Deploy GPT-4 in Azure AI Studio, set tokens/temperature, test prompts.

Computer Vision

Azure AI Vision

Image analysis, object detection, OCR, spatial analysis.

Practice: Upload images, run OCR, detect objects.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Azure AI Language

Sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, translation, summarization.

Practice: Feed sample text, extract entities.

Speech

Azure AI Speech

Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, translation.

Practice: Convert audio file → transcript, text → voice.

Information Extraction

Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer)

Extract data from structured/unstructured docs (invoices, receipts).

Practice: Train a custom model with sample documents.

Knowledge Mining

Azure AI Search (with Cognitive Search)

Index content, semantic search, enrichment pipelines.

Practice: Connect data source → build knowledge index → query it.

2. Plan, Create, and Deploy an Azure AI Foundry Service

Responsible AI Principles

Fairness, reliability, safety, privacy/security, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability.

Practice: Configure content filters, prompt shields, and blocklists.

Create AI Resources

Deploy via Azure Portal, CLI, ARM/Bicep templates, or Terraform.

Model Choice

Match business case → appropriate model (OpenAI, custom vision, language, etc.).

Deployment

Options: real-time endpoints, batch inference, container deployment.

Practice: Deploy GPT-4 as real-time endpoint, call it via Python SDK.

SDKs & APIs

azure-ai-textanalytics, azure-cognitiveservices-vision, azure-ai-formrecognizer, openai SDK.

Practice: Write Python/Node.js code to call multiple services.

Default Endpoint

Found in resource → “Keys and Endpoints” blade.

Use consistent endpoint for SDK/API calls.

CI/CD Integration

Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions pipelines.

Automate model deployment, version control, and testing.

Container Deployment

Services (Speech, Vision, Form Recognizer) support Docker containers for offline/edge use.

Practice: Run AI service in a local Docker container.

3. Manage, Monitor, and Secure an Azure AI Foundry Service

Monitoring

Use Azure Monitor, App Insights, Diagnostics logs.

Track: latency, errors, token consumption.

Cost Management

Azure Cost Management + Budgets.

Set usage quotas and alerts.

Account Keys

Store securely in Azure Key Vault.

Rotate keys periodically.

Authentication

Use Managed Identity instead of API keys when possible.

4. Implement AI Solutions Responsibly

Content Moderation

Use Azure AI Content Safety (detect harmful text/images).

Enable filters (profanity, violence, sexual, self-harm).

Responsible AI Insights

Configure dashboards for content safety.

Monitor for bias and harmful outputs.

Prevent Harmful Behavior

Use prompt shields, blocklists.

Limit jailbreak attacks.

Governance

Define RAI policy framework.

Include compliance, ethical reviews, escalation policies.
