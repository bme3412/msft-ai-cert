Introduction
Generative AI applications are built on language models. The development process usually starts with an exploration and comparison of available foundation models to find the one that best suits the particular needs of your application. After selecting a suitable model, you deploy it to an endpoint where it can be consumed by a client application or AI agent.

Foundation models, such as the GPT family of models, are state-of-the-art language models designed to understand, generate, and interact with natural language. Some common use cases for models are:

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion. For example, generate subtitles for videos.
Machine translation. For example, translate text from English to Japanese.
Text classification. For example, label an email as spam or not spam.
Entity extraction. For example, extract keywords or names from a document.
Text summarization. For example, generate a short one-paragraph summary from a multi-page document.
Question answering. For example, provide answers to questions like "What is the capital of France?"
Reasoning. For example, solve a mathematical problem.
