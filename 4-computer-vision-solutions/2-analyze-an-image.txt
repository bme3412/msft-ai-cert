Analyze an image

After connecting to your Azure AI Vision resource endpoint, your client application can use the service to perform image analysis tasks.

Note the following requirements for image analysis:

The image must be presented in JPEG, PNG, GIF, or BMP format.
The file size of the image must be less than 4 megabytes (MB).
The dimensions of the image must be greater than 50 x 50 pixels.

Submitting an image for analysis
To analyze an image, you can use the Analyze Image REST method or the equivalent method in the SDK for your preferred programming language, specifying the visual features you want to include in the analysis.

Available visual features are contained in the VisualFeatures enumeration:

VisualFeatures.TAGS: Identifies tags about the image, including objects, scenery, setting, and actions
VisualFeatures.OBJECTS: Returns the bounding box for each detected object
VisualFeatures.CAPTION: Generates a caption of the image in natural language
VisualFeatures.DENSE_CAPTIONS: Generates more detailed captions for the objects detected
VisualFeatures.PEOPLE: Returns the bounding box for detected people
VisualFeatures.SMART_CROPS: Returns the bounding box of the specified aspect ratio for the area of interest
VisualFeatures.READ: Extracts readable text
Specifying the visual features you want analyzed in the image determines what information the response will contain. Most responses will contain a bounding box (if a location in the image is reasonable) or a confidence score (for features such as tags or captions).

Processing the response
This method returns a JSON document containing the requested information. The JSON response for image analysis looks similar to this example, depending on your requested features:
