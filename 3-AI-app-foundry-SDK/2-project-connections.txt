Work with project connections

Each Azure AI Foundry project includes connected resources, which are defined both at the parent (Azure AI Foundry resource or hub) level, and at the project level. Each resource is a connection to an external service, such as Azure storage, Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI, or another Azure AI Foundry resource.

With the Azure AI Foundry SDK, you can connect to a project and retrieve connections; which you can then use to consume the connected services.

For example, the AIProjectClient object in Python has a connections property, which you can use to access the resource connections in the project. Methods of the connections object include:

connections.list(): Returns a collection of connection objects, each representing a connection in the project. You can filter the results by specifying an optional connection_type parameter with a valid enumeration, such as ConnectionType.AZURE_OPEN_AI.

connections.get(connection_name, include_credentials): Returns a connection object for the connection with the name specified. If the include_credentials parameter is True (the default value), the credentials required to connect to the connection are returned - for example, in the form of an API key for an Azure AI services resource.

The connection objects returned by these methods include connection-specific properties, including credentials, which you can use to connect to the associated resource.
