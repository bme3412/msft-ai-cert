Plan a responsible generative AI solution

The Microsoft guidance for responsible generative AI is designed to be practical and actionable. It defines a four stage process to develop and implement a plan for responsible AI when using generative models. The four stages in the process are:

Map potential harms that are relevant to your planned solution.
Measure the presence of these harms in the outputs generated by your solution.
Mitigate the harms at multiple layers in your solution to minimize their presence and impact, and ensure transparent communication about potential risks to users.
Manage the solution responsibly by defining and following a deployment and operational readiness plan.
